# DSLR-camera-dolly-stepper
a cart to step-photograph a narrow field of view with a macro-lens.
The point was to use four steppermotors (coz i had them and needed for wheelholders).
At this writing-point (april 24 2022) i have resived a PCB (printed circuit board) that i designed wrong... a better is on the way from PCBways.com
for now i have four Stepper-motor-drivers-pcb. 

I use:
* Four stepper drivers (that will be integraded in the new Arduino shield i designed) ULN2003 Stepper motor drive
* Arduino Uno.
* four "steip 28byj-48 5v dc" motors
* wpsh338 arduino shield velleman (Whadda) HM10 bluetooth serial communication chip.
* 4 3dprinted stepper-motor-holders (used Open Scad)
* 4 3dprinted wheels.(used Open Scad)
* 9 volt battery, but anything from 6 to 9 is perfect.
* all my buildings will be documented in this folder.
